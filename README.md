# ITCompany-Python-OOP

-This project is made for practicing and gaining experience with Python basics and Python OOP. 

-The Project is an IT Company that has different types of employees and projects. 

-The goal of this project is to make something simple but effective project. 

-This Project is designed as resume Project. With this Project I want to try some basic Python stuff, loops, conditions, playing with functions, basic OOP concepts, Inheritance, Polymorphism. 

-Maybe this Project is missing destructors and when I delete Teams, Employees, Projects. They need to be also destructed with a destructor so the memory can be freed. --

-Maybe this Project can be upgraded or better optimised but I'm satisfied.

-For better planning I created a Diagram(it's not perfect but it helped me a lot when building it) for the classes I'm using in this Project.

-To run the project you need to have python3 installed. You download the code and you open the folder where the code is using the command line. You write:
# python main.py
You will be greeted with a "menu" what you can do with the system !

-I hope you like this project and find it helpful !
